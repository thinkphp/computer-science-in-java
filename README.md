Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web servers and application servers
Games
Database connection
And much, much more!

## Why use Java?

Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)

* It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
* It has a large demand in the current job market
* It is easy to learn and simple to use
* It is open-source and free
* It is secure, fast and powerful
* It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
* Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
* As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

```
String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
```

## Data Types

```
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
String myText = "Hello";     // String
```
