# Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation

What can we learn from looking at a group of numbers?

In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us:

* Mean - The average value
* Median - The mid point value
* Mode - The most common value

Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.

A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.

A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.
